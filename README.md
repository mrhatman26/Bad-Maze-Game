# Bad-Maze-Game
A bad maze game that I created using pygame. I wouldn't recommened playing this, but enjoy it if you do?<br>

To run the game, either download the release or use Python to run "game.py".<br>

This was made using the following libraries:<br>
  -pygame<br>
  -random<br>
  -sys<br>
  -csv<br>
